        <p>Capgemini supports you in your personal growth and aims for you to #GETTHEFUTUREYOUWANT.</p>
        <p>You are engaging in continuous development activities and conversations with your People Manager 
            and peers, aimed at providing you guidance and opportunities for you to progress.
        </p>
        <p>This process is designed to capture all elements (priorities, feedback, development activities, 
            aspirations and challenges) that you have been exchanging with your People Manager, in one simple 
            form. At the end of this process, you and your People Manager can identify whether there should be 
            any changes to priorities.
        </p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns relating to this process, you can contact your People Manager, 
            your HR Business Partner or easily obtain more information on the People Experience intranet.
